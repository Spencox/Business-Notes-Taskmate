# Business-Notes-Taskmate

## Description
This program is a helpful app for creating a dynamic list of business task and notes that can be created and deleted depending on if the task is complete. The motivation behind this app is to get small business people to have a free and easy tool to keep track of all the tasks needed to run their business. I learned about express, express routing, and using async functions.
